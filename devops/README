### How to install docker on Ubuntu 20.04 on raspberry pi 4

I chose install from package: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-from-a-package

#### Download and install packages at: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/focal/pool/stable/arm64/

```
sudo dpkg -i containerd.io_1.3.7-1_arm64.deb
sudo dpkg -i docker-ce-cli_19.03.13~3-0~ubuntu-focal_arm64.deb
sudo dpkg -i docker-ce_19.03.13~3-0~ubuntu-focal_arm64.deb
```

#### Run docker command without sudo:

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
docker run hello-world
```

#### Install docker-compose for aarch64
After google a while. I downloaded existed binary docker-compose although it's quite out of date. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/arm64/docker-compose/1.25.0-1 . Current version is already 1.27.4

```
# This will be failed due to lack of dependencies
sudo dpkg -i docker-compose_1.25.0-1_all.deb
# Fix previous failed by this
sudo apt-get install -f
```

#### Next actions. dockerize the django apps

Refer to:

- https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/dockerized-django
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/

#### Things to do when first deploy code on new machine

- Edit .env_dev_sample file
- Install docker and docker-compose (skip if already had)
- make build (to cpoy source code to devops/)
- docker-compose build and docker-compose up
- docker-compose restart web (since the first launch, web always faster than db, db has to init its database, so web will complain that can't connect to db. restart web will help)
- docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations bk (prepare to migrate, if user is asked, just give None, since no user created yet and no item as well).
- docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
- docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
- Go to http://192.168.1.13:8000/api2/ to check the REST api.
